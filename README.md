This project is a low-level implementation of the paper titled "**LipNet: End-to-End Sentence-level Lipreading**" ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01599)), which uses deep learning techniques for recognizing lip movements and converting them into text. Unlike the original paper, this implementation employs static slicing instead of the deep learning approach described in the paper.

The model utilizes the GRID corpus database ([link](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/gridcorpus/)) for training and evaluation purposes. The dataset and pre-trained model links are provided in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

This project features a full-stack web application built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the lipreading model through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Low-level implementation of the LipNet paper using static slicing
- Utilizes the GRID corpus database for training and evaluation
- Full-stack web application built with Streamlit for easy interaction
- Jupyter Notebook with links to dataset and pre-trained model downloads
